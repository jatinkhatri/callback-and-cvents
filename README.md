## Sample Test case
- Case 1

Sample Input For Custom Testing 100 1000 

Sample Output Multiples of 100 1000 6500

Explanation Multiples of 100 are 100,200,300,......1000 and multiples of 1000 is 1000 in below and including 1000. Sum =(100+200+............1000) + 1000 Sum = 6500 

-  Case 2

Sample Input For Custom Testing 500 1200 

Sample Output Multiples of 500 1200 1500
